Compatibility:
-

- These aren't hard rules, but compatibility will be best following these.
- Install after Rogue Rebalancing. Several RR files need to be patched for full compatiblity.
- Install after class revision mods, unless they specifically say to install after any kits.
- Install after mods that revise or overwrite spells.

#### Spellcasting systems:
- Compatible with Faiths and Powers spheres system. Can install before or after FnP.
- Compatible with Deities of Faerun spheres system. Install this mod after DoF.
- Compatible with subtledoctor's 5e casting mod. Install this mod before 5e casting.
&emsp;You should also install the extra component related to 5e casting.

#### HLA traps/songs:
- The Crow Hunter and Powder Keg kits need specific handling of HLA traps and songs. 
- Currently, this mod accounts for Rogue Rabalancing hlas.
- If you know of any others, let me know and I can add it.
- Only abilities gained by the base class are relevant for this.

There are no game-breaking errors if a file isn't patched.  
The unpatched HLAs just won't work 100% right with these kits.

Additional Info (Kit Abilities):
-

- Affected by Wild/Dead Magic zones:  
&emsp;Denial (Grave Warden)  
&emsp;Moonlight Vortex (Moonlight Knight)  
&emsp;Force (Temple Knight)  
&emsp;Bolt of Glory (Temple Knight)

- Can be dispelled:  
&emsp;Denial  
&emsp;Moonlight Vortex (magic resist)  
&emsp;Frenzying Flame (status effects)

- Can be removed by Zone of Sweet Air  
&emsp;Incinerate (Warhound)  
&emsp;Dust Explosion (Powder Keg)

- Blood transfusions will be removed by a Restoration or Greater Restoration.  
- Bleeding effects can be cured by Heal or Greater Restoration, or by the Blood Minister's "Healing Blood".

A few other kit abilities are also spell-like, but I decided not to make them affected by Wild/Dead Magic. It's standard for kit abilities in these games not to be affected. The above abilities are cast like spells so I thought it'd look dumb for them not to be affected by Magic Zones.

- These abilities are gained only if a Beast Hunter is also in the party.

When Riftstep is cast, a portal opens up in front of the caster, who immediately steps through it. The character may move freely within the rift for 7 seconds while others are frozen in time, but cannot attack, cast spells, or use any items or abilities. After 7 seconds, another portal opens up and the caster steps out of the rift.

Duration: Instant  
Casting Time: 1

Saving Throw: None

The caster selects a target and opens up two Dimension Doors, linked through the Astral Plane, which immediately transfer both target and caster, switching their positions. This spell can be used on both allies and enemies, and the target does not need to be in visual range. As long as the caster knows the target's position on the map, this spell can be cast on it.

---

(Abjuration)

Range: 0  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 4  
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius

All creatures within the area at the time of casting, whether ally, enemy, or neutral, are enclosed by a protective Sanctuary for one turn. Creatures under a Sanctuary cannot be directly targeted by spells or attacks. There is no Saving Throw and the spell ignores magic resistance.

A sanctuaried creature can move around or cast non-attack spells without breaking the spell. Any combat actions, for example, casting a Fireball, a True Sight, or a summoning spell, will remove the Sanctuary.

---

**Jolt**  
(Alteration, Evocation) 

Level: 5  
Range: Special  
Duration: Permanent   
Casting Time: 5  
Area of Effect: 1 party member  
Saving Throw: Special

Upon casting this spell, the caster restores a fallen creature back to a sliver of health. The target can be of any race and must be a member of the party. To use this spell, cast it on the dead character's portrait.

Casting Time: 6  
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius  
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell fires an orb of pure energy at a creature, inflicting 1d4+2 points of electrical damage per level of the caster to the target and any within 5 feet. A 15th level caster, for example, would inflict 15d4+30 damage. Creatures may attempt a save vs. Spell for half damage.

---

**Revitalizer**  
(Necromancy, Evocation)

Level: 7  
Range: Visual range of the caster  
Duration: Permanent  
Casting Time: 1  
Area of Effect: 1 creature  
Saving Throw: None

The caster shoots a golden, pulsating orb at a creature in visual range, restoring 20 + 1d4 Hit Points per level of the caster. A 15th level caster, for example, would restore 20 + 15d4 Hit Points. 

IWD: The spell does not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those not living.

---

**Riftgate**  
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 8  
Range: 30 ft.  
Duration: 1 turn  
Casting Time: 9  
Area of Effect: Special  
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster opens a rift in spacetime to a place far beyond the stars. After a moment, a Juggernaut Golem emerges from the rift. The golem stays for 1 turn and will obey the caster as long as it remains summoned. Due to the energy exerted in the summoning process, the caster must wait 1 turn between each use of this spell.

A rift should be handled with caution. When this spell is cast, there is a 2% chance to attract the attention of a balor, who will destroy the golem and exit the rift in its place, intent only on tearing the caster and <PRO_HISHER> companions apart piece by piece. A Protection From Evil spell will not make the fiend ignore the party.
