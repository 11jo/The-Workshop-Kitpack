Sphere systems

Supports custom spheres from these mods:
- Faiths and Powers
- Deities of Faerun
- Talents of Faerun

- tested with FnP v0.90 (also works with v0.84.5)
- tested with DoF v1.9.8
- tested with ToF beta 13


FnP install info:
- The multiclass kits do not require the FnP multiclass mod for compatibility with FnP.
- For best compatibility, install this mod AFTER applying the sphere system.
- It will still work if installed before FnP, but Air and Water spheres will be switched for some kits.

Faiths and Powers

NOTE: Some FnP spells are given by more than one sphere. However, the description will still only say one sphere. That's why you may see some spells with spheres that aren't listed here for a kit.

Deities of Faerun

NOTE: My Ranger and Paladin kits will gain spells up to 7th level (similar to FnP). They can't actually cast these spells without the spell slots. I did it this way because there are several tweaks (i.e. from cdtweaks or OlvynSpells) that allow Rangers and Paladins to cast higher level spells.

Talents of Faerun

- Sphere lists will appear in the kit description. Nature sphere only appears if it has spells in it.
- Moonlight Knight intentionally has Divine sphere, instead of Nature. I didn't want to give Moonlight Knight CR both Nature and Divine, so went with Divine. The single class also has Divine to match up with the cleric/ranger version (rangers normally have Nature sphere).
