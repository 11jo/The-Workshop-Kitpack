Faiths & Powers

NOTE: Some FnP spells are given by more than one sphere. However, the description will still only show one sphere. That's why you may see some spells with spheres that aren't listed here for a kit.

Deities of Faerun

NOTE: My Ranger and Paladin kits will gain spells up to 7th level (similar to FnP). They can't actually cast these spells without the spell slots. I did it this way because there are several tweaks (i.e. from cdtweaks or OlvynSpells) that allow Rangers and Paladins to cast higher level spells.
