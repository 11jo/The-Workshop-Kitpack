Sphere systems

- for Faiths & Powers and Deities of Faerun mods
- tested with FnP v0.84.5 (update: tested with v0.85sd19)
- tested with DoF v1.9.8
- The lists here are accurate for v3.0+ of this mod.


FnP install info:
- The multiclass kits do not require the FnP multiclass mod for compatibility with FnP.
- For best compatibility, install this mod AFTER applying the sphere system.
- It will still work if installed before FnP, but Air and Water spheres will be switched for some kits.

Faiths & Powers

NOTE: Some FnP spells are given by more than one sphere. However, the description will still only say one sphere. That's why you may see some spells with spheres that aren't listed here for a kit.

Deities of Faerun

NOTE: My Ranger and Paladin kits will gain spells up to 7th level (similar to FnP). They can't actually cast these spells without the spell slots. I did it this way because there are several tweaks (i.e. from cdtweaks or OlvynSpells) that allow Rangers and Paladins to cast higher level spells.
